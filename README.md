# VelocityTester

This project was created during my Interactive Scripting class in the Spring of 2021. I built it to test the maximum speed of projectiles in the Unity physics engine. *result: I got bored after 7000m/s.* I ended up idly building the final for that class in this project and had enough fun with the project to continue working on it for awhile.
